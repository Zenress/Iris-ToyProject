# **Iris ToyProject**

This project is a **Classification model** using the **Iris Dataset**. The model used is a **DecisionTree** and it is made primarily using **SKlearn** and **Pandas**

This project is meant to serve as a sort of ability guaging to see what i can do with my own skills.
The project also helped me with building a more **team oriented** mindset and understanding of how i should **structure repositories**, **the code** and this **README file**. So that other people might be able to understand it easier

I've learned a lot about **Data analysis**, **Github repositories**, **library/dependency** **management** and **User Experience**

## The libraries used are

- *Pandas*
- *Pandas Profiling*
- *SKlearn (StratifiedKFold, Preprocessing, Metrics and DecisionTreeClassifier)*
- *Matplotlib Pyplot*
- *Pickle*
- *Numpy*
- *Yaml*
- *Argparse*

## Setup

### Installation

To run this project you should create a **Conda Environment** (<https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>) to run it on. This will help with making sure it can run in it's default configuration

The **Conda Environment** file `configuration/conda_env.yaml` makes it easy to create the environment to run this project.

To create the environment, you should type the command in console:

```console
conda env create -f configuration/conda_env.yaml
```

After having created the environment you also have to activate it:

```console
conda activate Iris_Project_Conda_Environment
```

### Removing the Conda Environment

To delete the conda environment you will have to locate where the Anaconda3 folder is, by default it is under: `C:\Users\YourUserHere\Anaconda3\envs`

You then delete the folder that matches the name of the Environment files configured name, by default it's name would be: `Iris_Project_Conda_Environment`

## Project usage

- *You can use it to predict whether what you write is an Iris Versicolor, Iris Setosa or Iris Virginica.*
- *You can use it to do data analysis on the dataset and figure out things about the original dataset.*
- *You can use it to test your knowledge about models and do some testing with the model.*

### Running the project

**Note:** *The commands below were run in an Anaconda prompt but can be run in a terminal / console just fine.*

#### Configuration

There is an included config.yaml file under the configuration folder. This file is where you would change different variables easily. Example:

```yaml
kfold_settings:
 nr_splits: 5
 shuffle: True
 random_state: 123
```

#### Prediction

This program is meant to predict on the saved training model from the Training Program, the prediction is made using your user input as well as a list of corresponding features, minimum and maximum values to predict what **Iris flower** it would be according to the given information

To run the Prediction program use the console command below:

```console
python source/models/prediction.py
```

**Note:** *Prediction is run in an iterative way, so that you only have to enter a number for the currently selected feature column*

#### Training

This program is gonna train the **DecisionTreeClassifier** Model with the **Iris Dataset**. To assure that it is accurate outside of the data it knows i have used a **StratifiedKFold** to split the data and **cross validate** it as well. It will make sure there is as even a distribution of labels as possible.

To run the Training program use the console command below:

```console
python source/models/training.py
```

There is also the option to enable graphing which will tell you how the **KFold** looks in terms of data distribution after the **KFold** and how **class label column** is distributed among the **KFold splits.**

To enable graphing on the training file, you would add `--graphs` to the end of the terminal command:

```console
python source/models/training.py --graphs
```

#### Data Analysis

This program is made to show you information, correlations, maximum and minimum, distributions and so on via a profiling module.

To start the program use the command:

```console
python source/visualization/data_analysis.py
```

Using **Data Analysis** tools i have been able to understand the dataset a lot better than i did before.

Pandas-profling gave me a detailed report about Correlation and Interactions, along with Maximum and Minimum ranges for each feature. (`reports/data_report.html`)

##### Dataset

The dataset used is the Iris Dataset (<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris>)

- 5 columns, headers added later on
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
  - Class
    - Iris Setosa
    - Iris Versicolor
    - Iris Virginica
- 150 records

The names we're derived from the documentation under **Attribute information** gathered here: <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris>
